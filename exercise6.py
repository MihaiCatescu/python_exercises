'''
Letâ€™s say I give you a list saved in a variable: a = [1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, 81, 100]. Write a function
that takes this list and makes a new list that has only the even elements of this list in it.

a = [1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, 81, 100]
b = []

def create_even_list():
    for number in a:
        if number % 2 == 0:
            b.append(number)

create_even_list()
print(b)
